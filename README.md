Hello there 👋👋👋

I am a Software Engineer focused on the frontend. I like risky and ambitious ideas. Very interested in making the impossible possible. Making a difference matter. I invested too much in JavaScript and I am willing to continue to do so. I love, like really really love, open-source projects. You can find the projects I've made below.

You have an intreating idea, reach me out and let's have a chat 🌍
